Disarium Number Challenge

The challenge was to be able to detect all disarium numbers in a range of numbers. You then had to print out the disarium numbers in that range seperated by a pole.
My code accepts the range from a user and scans through it to find all disarium numbers. It then prints out the values seperated by a pole.
